# Simple Backend for ES8266 based Jalousie-Control

this is mainly an Arduino Sketch file for the ESP8266 NodeMCU v12 4MB

This is a dirty and fast approach to control the living-room jalousie.
It's supposed to be replaced by the SimpleSmartHome Project.
Since this will take a while, i made this dirty fast solution with pretty much no effort, till it can be replaced.

There is a Frontend: [Frontend](https://github.com/KaiGrassnick/simple-jalousie-frontend)


**Note:** This code should only be used for test purposes since it's realy bad and might be unstable


## Incomplete Instructions
- Change SSID & Password to connect to an existing WiFi
- If there is none you can lower the timeout for AP to e.g. 1
- There is an option to disable AP creation if no WiFi was found or the ESP could not connect in time (see timeout)


## Simple help
* List files: `/list?dir=/`
* Delete files: `/delete?path=index.html` (get filename by list command)
* Upload files: `/upload`
* Update (OTA): `/update` (accepts .bin files, generated by e.g. arduino-ide)


## ToDo:
If this is going to be further developed:
* make list files easier to use -> add a frontend
* improve control logic
* optimize code (well ... a complete rewrite would be the best)
